## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I wanted to touch up a few UI things. During testing I found a few issues. I brought up the need to move the position of buttons that were not in a useful place and the changes I describe below that I changed. I fixed the user experience in the setup pages. There used to be the only way of going to the next page was by clicking a progress bar at the next place, but it was unclear that it was clickable so I created a button that does the same functionality, but is more available. Another experience function I added was labeling of a priority bar on a scale of low to high in the add & edit modals for assignments I also to implement a change to the navbar that makes it less crowded, but it is too close to the presentation to modify the production branch, so I will put off a merge until after the presentation.


## This Week's Plan

Prepping for the presentation. I want to change a few more UI changes before the end of the semester, like finishing the navbar style.

## Anything Blocking?

No technical blockers. :)

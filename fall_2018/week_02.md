## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Last week, I had an excused absence to go to Grace Hopper. I managed to remotely check on the skeleton Pull request
and suggested a few small changes and this is being merged today.

## This Week's Plan

I hope that I will be able to make a set of routes to work off of.

## Anything Blocking?

Only blocker right now is catching up with work I missed last week and communication with the rest of the team.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

I found an approach I want to use for assignment editing. I made an edit assignment modal similar to the add assignment modal where all the fields already have values and are changeable. Right now this is done onclick of the assignments description just because thats old code now, but I think I will have a font awesome pencil icon in the future that will be the 'button' to click to edit. Also in the teams normal Saturday meeting, I helped design an intuitive button that toggles a visual cue to if an assignment is done or not with a font awesome fas fa check vs far fa circle.

## This Week's Plan

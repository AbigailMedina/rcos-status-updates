LAST WEEK I wrote the text below to know how to start and also drew a first draft of a gui on paper based off of compiled group input on use-cases:

Core Purpose:
Replace the need for lazy students to figure out what they should be doing at any given moment.

How we are going to do it:
	1)Automatically schedule work times for specific tasks around daily schedule.
	2)Remind student when they should be doing a specific task
	3)Update scheduled work times based on their completion of task

Use Case 1:

Student gets hw assignment from class A. They open LATE and see VIEW 1. 
They navigate to VIEW 2, which lets them add the assignment with appropriate information associated. While in VIEW 2, they also remove the last assignment from class A that they just finished.
The student navigates to VIEW 1 to see their current work lineup and leaves LATE.

Use Case 2:

Student gets text from LATE saying that they are scheduled to be studying for class A test in 30 mins for two hours. They dismiss the text and walk to the library to study. :) When the two hours is up, student gets a text from LATE saying its time to go have fun and to reply "y" if they had spent the allotted time studying. Student responds y and closes phone.

Then I began work on the VIEW 1 described above.

THIS COMING WEEK I plan on finishing a rough draft of View 1 and getting out live

BLOCKERS

Im blocked by lack of knowledge of pug, which we are using instead of html. I also need to figure out how to have it work with js somehow.
Im used to using jsx where I can write some js functions relevant to the html in the same file...

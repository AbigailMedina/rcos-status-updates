## Last Week's Accomplishments

Using the new Vue integration, I was able to make the dashboard interactive.
I also made a few logo options: a favicon and a general logo

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Get info from backend to be displayed on dashboard instead of dummy data. Maybe some styling.

## Anything Blocking?

Vue, webpack learning curve, backend keeping up with what I need.(There is a small refactor going on right now across the app)

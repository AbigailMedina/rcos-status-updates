## Last Week's Accomplishments

During Thanksgiving break, the be was finished for the implementation of assignment editing. So that was connected and merged to master. I also created the presentation for the group since we are presenting soon.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week I want to touch up a few things. Starting with UI/UX stuff like making transitions in the setup pages more clear and labeling of the priority bar. 

## Anything Blocking?

No technical blockers. We skipped a saturday meeting due to thanksgiving break so there is a blocker in communication until this coming saturday. Otherwise, I have had some health issues recently that has taken my attention away from work, so im a little behind in most of my work.

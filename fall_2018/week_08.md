## Last Week's Accomplishments

Fixed the compilation error I was having. I asked Frank to explicitly walk me through the way to run master and I was just running the wrong commands, because they were outdated. Taking that frustration, I updated the readme to show the updated way to run master/any other branch and I will probably be the one to update it in the future as well. I jumped onto editing an `assignment`. It took me a while to look through the code to see how to accomplish this with vue. My first attempt was an inline edit field toggled onClick, which worked ok but became tedious and required too many variables in state.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to approach assignment editing differently somehow.


## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking besides time commitments to my job. My boss has been bothering me to do a lot this week..

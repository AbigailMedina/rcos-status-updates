Fix compilation error and maybe jump on new task? I want to work on a new part of the app.

## Anything Blocking?

Ive had a compilation error for a while. I posted something on helpdesk with no answer. I also looked into asking the group, but there was a schedule conflict for this past weekends meeting, so I wasnt able to get help yet.

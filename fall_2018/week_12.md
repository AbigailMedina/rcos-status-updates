## Last Week's Accomplishments

I changed a couple things in the navbar and footer for simplicity of design like only letting the about page be accessed through the footer, not the navbar, since that wont be accessed that often. Also I took out some of the wordiness from the footer, to make it cleaner. Also I fixed the flow between pages for user setup. All of this is in a PR called Last minute ui Changes
I also came up with an idea for a future RCOS hackathon. I told Varun and he said hed bring it up. I also filled out the rcos mentor form.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

I got js functions working onClick. Then I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to have the view change in response to a variable change with that js function. With a lot of research, I decided to use Vue and with the help of Frank, set up Vue and webpack to make the integration easier. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Have a view be reactive to user input with the use of vue. I hope to be able to display different amounts of a schedule based off a users choice. (Week vs day)

## Anything Blocking?

Pug, Vue, webpack learning curve, and lack of sufficient communication between team members since we missed a normal weekly meeting on saturday since it was parents weekend last weekend.

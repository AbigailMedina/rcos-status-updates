## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I watched a good percentage of this wagtail playlist as well as played around with the skills being taught and tried to mirror them in pipeline. ex: adding different field types/page types. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMQHMcNi6ocsS8Bfnuy_IDgJ4bHRRrvub

## This Week's Plan
> I will either brute force understand how to know page types from get_context or meet with pragati one on one so she can teach me.

## Anything Blocking?
> same as before

## Notes
>

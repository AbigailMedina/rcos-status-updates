## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I created a shirt survey that will be finished awaiting images of the example shirts. I also attended the open house to represent rcos.

In templates/core/includes/articles_list.html:    {% for article in articles %}
where is articles coming from?
the ArticlesIndexPage model's get_context function?

I read through the documentation for page models in wagail and Im still confused. I will have to ask a more senior pipeline developer for more help with this on tuesday. https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.6.2/topics/pages.html


## This Week's Plan
> I will figure out how to navigate class structure in the code. 

## Anything Blocking?
> Wagtail is hard to understand and not many people on the team really understand it.

## Notes

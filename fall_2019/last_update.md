## Notes
> 
Project Name: Pipeline
Development contributions:

- My main contributions include finding, documenting how to use, and refactoring the custom styles for the project. 
This was important due to the previous lack of documentation of how to effect styling, which many people on the team needed. After finding the location of the styles, I had to figure out how to change them so they effect the local version. I ended up adding a script to watch the styles and update on save. Then I added documentation to the readme to let future developers know how to use styles.

- My other main conribution is in refactoring the article page class into multiple; one for each article type including news, opinion, sports, etc.
This was an issue that each time a page type wanted customization, the additon would have to go in the article page class. This was not only creating a god class but also making the code unreadable and unextendible.
After the refactor, I created a dummy personalization as the first subtyped feature: author image for an opinion article.

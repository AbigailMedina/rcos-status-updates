## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Last week I styled the author image and fixed the preview/live view bug. by accessing the runtime type of the page and accessing the correct template. I also restructured the styles written in styles.scss to be in proper sass format versus the current css format. Turns out I made a mistake there, but it is being worked out.

## This Week's Plan
> Work on the presentation and debugging/testing the articlepagesubtype feature.

## Anything Blocking?
> none

## Last Week's Accomplishments
I successfully hosted the systers/rcos event with ~20 person turnout.
I had a separate meeting with lyle concerning his issue on github for creating a dark theme and have been trying to figure out where the sites styling originates. I have been told recently it might require a rebuild of webpack for every css change
## This Week's Plan
>Finish css search and help lyle deploy his issue. Then work on documentation on how to change styling for the future.

## Anything Blocking?
I was out for a week at a conference and was not available for rcos sessions.

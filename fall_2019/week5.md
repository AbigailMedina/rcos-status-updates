## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I figured out how to make style changes in the front end and have local changes reflected on localhost on save with webpack watch. I documented this in the readme and created a PR. I also  started researching how I might go about making article type (news vs opinion) specific style options, which means that I have to understand wagtails/djangos type heirarchy better. Ive looked into using super() but im not sure that is the right approach.

## This Week's Plan
> I will figure out how to navigate class structure in the code. 

## Anything Blocking?
> Wagtail is hard to understand and not many people on the team really understand it.

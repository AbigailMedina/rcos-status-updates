## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I created the classes for each type of article page and created a imageChooserPanel for the opinionArticlePage class for an author image

## This Week's Plan
> Style the author image, fix the weird preview/live view bug. While im working out how to fix that issue, I also want to restructure the styles written in styles.scss to be in proper sass format versus the current css format.

## Anything Blocking?
> The preview view of an opinion article shows the correct/expected view of the page with the author image, but when it is published, the view live version is not accurate.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I fixed the implementation for the progress bar for both exams and assignments. I also fixed some UI problems such as removing an export assignment/exam button that we arent using and fixed the addAssignmentModal progress checklist. Finally, I allowed the functionality to edit assigments whose due dates have passed.

## This Week's Plan

> I added myself to issue 252 which shows progress percent on a collapsed view of an assignment, which currently only shows 0% or 100%.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

No blockers currently.

## Notes

> Nothing to note

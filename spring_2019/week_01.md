## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week I updated the about us page to be more attractive. I also tested and found that I wanted a progress bar visible for assignment completion. I then began work on this and finished the implementation in branch 'progress bar'.

## This Week's Plan

>This week I want to redesign the location of the progress bar so that it fits in better with the new UI on master. Then grab another task from the issue list.

## Anything Blocking?

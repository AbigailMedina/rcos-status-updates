## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I refactored the progress bar I was working on, as It was unfunctional for test types of assessments and so can only be shown for assignment types, so it needed to be moved. My PR was accepted.

## This Week's Plan

>This week I want to see what it will take to implement the progress bar for assessments, and try implementing it.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Although I planned on fixing Edit Assignment Bug #273, I documented all the work I could figure out on the bug comments and unclaimed the issue becuase I could not figure it out.
I searched for more bugs and reported some: #286
I also changed a styling issue for types of icons used for the collapsing of the sidebar, since it was one that was suggesting an undo, when it should have been a chevron, which is more commonly used for collapse actions

## This Week's Plan

> I want to continue bug reporting and interface fixes.

## Anything Blocking?

## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I was busy grading and thus did not get around to coding. I did look over the issue list and messaged the reporters on issues that I thought needed to be revisited such as if they no longer were applicable or appeared to be fixed already.

## This Week's Plan

> This week is spring break, I dont plan on doing work.

## Anything Blocking?

## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I found an annoying bug that displays a problem in how we are using Vue for reactive components. 
My bug report:
Editing an assignments due time is broken

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
-go to an assignment page
-click edit details button (yellow)
-edit the due time
-save
-notice the due time is reset to 12am until refresh of page

I spent a couple hours researching Vue's reactivity: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on finishing up the bug for Edit Assignment Bug #273

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Need to research more on Vue reactivity

## Notes

> Nothing to note

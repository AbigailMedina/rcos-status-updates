## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Organized project pairing and project to room pairing, optimizing grouping projects with other projects they have had before. Had the "how to write a good proposal" bonus session with pragati. Ran small groups and helped create slides for small and large groups. Planned a mentor meeting agenda, although it was postponed due to weather.

## This Week's Plan
> Reaching out to rcos students interested in having an ibm mentor. Reaching out to Blaine to see if he wants to talk at next large group 2/11. Need to fit in a mentor meeting after large group also on 2/11. Need to create an official rubric for proposals and grade existing project proposals.

## Anything Blocking?
> None
